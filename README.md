# Procwatch 

Procwatch is a lightweight Linux process monitoring tool designed to flag suspicious activity based on heuristics. It periodically inspects running processes, assigns risk scores, and can take configurable actions such as alerting, killing, or dumping process artifacts.

## Features

* **ML-assisted Anomaly Scoring**: Uses a trained model to calculate an anomaly score for each process.
* **Heuristics-based Detection**:

  * Deleted executables still running
  * Processes executing from `/tmp` or `/dev/shm`
  * Writable + Executable (W+X) memory regions
  * Ptrace usage
  * High CPU usage
  * Empty command-line arguments
  * Suspicious outbound network connections (e.g., high ports, non-standard destinations)
* **Risk Scoring**: Each heuristic contributes to a weighted score.
* **Actions**:

  * Alert (log suspicious processes)
  * Kill suspicious processes (`--kill-on-alert`)
  * Stop scanning after first alert (`--stop-on-alert`)
  * Dump process artifacts (`--dump`) for forensic review
* **Artifacts Dumped**:

  * Executable path
  * Command line
  * Environment variables
  * Memory maps
  * File descriptors
* **Configuration**:

  * YAML-based config file for weights, thresholds, whitelists
  * Default config built-in, can be extended via `~/.procwatch.yaml`

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Linux system with `/proc`
* Optional: `psutil` for enhanced CPU/memory stats

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ren-Gen22/procSentinel.git
cd procSentinel
pip install .
```

This will install the `procwatch` command-line tool.


## Usage

Procwatch has two main commands: `scan` and `train`.

### Scanning

Basic scan (single run):

```bash
procwatch scan
```

Continuous monitoring every 10s:

```bash
procwatch scan --interval 10
```

Kill flagged processes (score >= `min_score`):

```bash
procwatch scan --kill-on-alert
```

Dump artifacts of flagged processes:

```bash
procwatch scan --dump /path/to/dump/dir
```

Combine options:

```bash
procwatch scan --interval 5 --dump /path/to/dump/dir --kill-on-alert
```

### Training

You can train a baseline model to detect anomalies.

```bash
procwatch train --duration 120
```
This will create a model file at `~/.local/share/procwatch/model.json`.

## Config Example (`~/.procwatch.yaml`)

```yaml
cpu_high: 75.0
min_score: 3.0
ml_weight: 2.0
ports: "80,443"
weights:
  deleted_exe: 5
  tmp_exe: 4
  wx_mem: 4
  ptrace: 5
  high_cpu: 3
  empty_cmdline: 2
  suspicious_port: 4
whitelist:
  exe_paths:
    - "/usr/bin/legit_tool"
  users:
    - "trusted_user"
```

## Recent Improvements

**v2.0 - Reduced False Detections**
* Added intelligent kernel thread detection - no longer flags system threads
* Improved name/argv mismatch detection to handle truncated names and setproctitle
* Enhanced whitelist dampening with more aggressive score reduction
* Permission-aware executable path checking
* Increased default min_score from 2 to 3 for better signal-to-noise ratio
* Expanded whitelist patterns for common kernel threads

These improvements dramatically reduce false positives while maintaining detection of real threats like deleted executables, fileless execution, and suspicious memory regions.

## Roadmap

* Add JSONL logging for structured alerts
* Expand heuristics (fileless execution, privilege escalation attempts)
* Systemd integration for persistent monitoring

## Disclaimer

Procwatch is a research/educational tool. Use with caution in production systems. Killing or dumping processes may impact running services.
